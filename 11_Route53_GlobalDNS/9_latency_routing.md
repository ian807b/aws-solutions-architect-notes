# 🌐 Latency Routing 

## 📌 Overview

Latency-based routing is a Route 53 routing policy designed to **optimize performance and reduce latency** by directing traffic to the AWS region that provides the **lowest network latency** for the user.

---

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Hosted Zone** contains multiple records with the **same name** (e.g., `www.example.com`).
2. Each record is tagged with a specific **AWS region**:

   - `US East 1`
   - `US West 1`
   - `AP Southeast 2`

3. When a DNS query is made, **Route 53 uses a latency database** to determine the closest region **in terms of latency**, not geography.
4. The record associated with the lowest latency is **returned to the client**.

> 🧠 Route 53 uses an IP geolocation service to determine the **user’s approximate location**, then queries its latency database to decide which region provides the best response time.

## ✅ Key Features

- **One record per AWS region** per name
- **Latency lookup** is based on AWS-maintained database
- Can be **combined with health checks**

  - If the lowest-latency endpoint is **unhealthy**, the next lowest is selected

- Helps improve **performance** of global applications

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- AWS's latency database is **not real-time**
- Local ISP congestion or routing issues are **not always considered**

> Still, latency-based routing generally provides **better performance** than random or static routing.

---

## 🔁 Example Scenario

You have deployed web servers in:

- `US East 1`
- `US West 1`
- `AP Southeast 2`

A user in Sydney, Australia, tries to access `www.animals4life.org`. Route 53:

- Identifies that the user is in Sydney
- Determines lowest latency is to **AP Southeast 2**
- Returns the record for that region

---

## 📈 When to Use

- Applications hosted **across multiple AWS regions**
- You care about **optimizing response time**
- You want **automatic failover** to next-best region in case of downtime (with health checks enabled)

# 🌍 Route 53 Geoproximity Routing

## 🧭 Summary

Geoproximity routing is a Route 53 routing policy that routes traffic **based on the distance** between your users and your resources. It allows more **granular control** over traffic distribution by supporting **bias adjustments**, making it suitable for advanced, location-aware architectures.

---

## 🚧 How It Works

- Route 53 uses the geographic **location of the user** and **location of the resource** to determine the nearest resource.
- It calculates the **shortest distance** and returns the record closest to the user.
- **AWS resources** are defined by their region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
- **External (non-AWS) resources** are defined by **latitude and longitude coordinates**.

---

## 🧮 Distance + Bias = Control

- **Bias** is a modifier you apply to influence routing decisions.
- **Positive bias (+)**: Expands the area a resource serves (makes it "closer").
- **Negative bias (-)**: Shrinks the area (makes it "further away").

### 🧠 Example Scenario

You have resources in:

- US (us-east-1)
- UK
- Australia (ap-southeast-2)

A user in Saudi Arabia:

- Closest by distance: **UK (\~6,700 km)**
- If you add a **+100 bias to Australia**, Route 53 might route Saudi Arabia users to **Australia (\~10,000 km)** instead.

---

## 🛠 Use Cases

- **Regional failover or proximity control**
- **Marketing campaigns** targeting users in specific areas
- **Controlling traffic load** by adjusting effective geographic reach

---

## ⚙️ Setup

To configure Geoproximity routing:

1. Use the **Route 53 Traffic Flow** feature (required).
2. Define **geoproximity rules**:

   - Region (for AWS resources)
   - Coordinates (for non-AWS resources)
   - Optional bias (+/- %)

3. Associate these rules with records of the same name (e.g., `www.example.com`)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Requires Traffic Flow**: You cannot configure geoproximity routing using standard record sets; you must use **Traffic Policies**.
- **Bias is optional**: But powerful if you need to override natural proximity behavior.
- **Different from Geolocation**:

  - Geolocation matches **specific user locations** (country, continent, etc.)
  - Geoproximity uses **distance** and **bias** for **relative closeness**

## 📌 Quick Comparison

| Feature                | Geolocation Routing         | Geoproximity Routing     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Based on               | User location               | User ↔ Resource distance |
| Allows partial matches | ✅ Yes (continent, default) | ❌ No                    |
| Allows bias?           | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                   |
| Requires Traffic Flow  | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                   |

Geoproximity routing is ideal for use cases that need flexible, geography-aware traffic distribution — especially when combined with Route 53 health checks and other routing types.

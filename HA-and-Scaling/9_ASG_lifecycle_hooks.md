# Auto Scaling Group Lifecycle Hooks

**Lifecycle Hooks** allow you to insert custom actions during the instance **launch** or **terminate** transitions.

---

## What Are Lifecycle Hooks?

Lifecycle hooks let you **pause** an instance's lifecycle at key transition points:

- **Launch transitions**
- **Terminate transitions**

Normally, these transitions (instance provisioning or termination) happen **automatically** and **instantly**, with no opportunity to inject custom logic.

With lifecycle hooks, you can:

- **Pause** the transition.
- Perform **custom actions** (e.g., config, backup, data indexing).
- **Resume** or **abandon** the transition based on outcome or timeout.

## Lifecycle Flow with Hooks

### Without Lifecycle Hooks

| Event           | State Transition                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Launch          | `Pending` ‚Üí `InService`              |
| Termination     | `Terminating` ‚Üí `Terminated`         |

You have **no control** or customization in these transitions.

### With Lifecycle Hooks

#### üöÄ Launch Hook Flow:
1. Instance enters `Pending`
2. Moves to `Pending:Wait` (hook pauses transition)
3. Perform custom actions (e.g., data indexing)
4. Then either:
   - Transition to `Pending:Proceed` ‚Üí `InService`
   - Or timeout and automatically proceed or abandon

#### üî• Terminate Hook Flow:
1. Instance enters `Terminating`
2. Moves to `Terminating:Wait` (hook pauses termination)
3. Perform actions (e.g., backup logs)
4. Then either:
   - Transition to `Terminating:Proceed` ‚Üí `Terminated`
   - Or timeout and proceed automatically

> ‚è± Default timeout is **3600 seconds** (1 hour)

## How to Resume the Process

- Use the API call:  
  `CompleteLifecycleAction`
- This resumes the transition manually after your custom action completes.

---

## Event-Driven Integration

Lifecycle hooks can trigger:

- **Amazon SNS**: Notify systems of the hook event
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Trigger automated workflows or Lambda functions

This enables **event-driven processing** of instance lifecycle changes.

---

## Use Cases

- **Launch Hooks**:
  - Install agents or software
  - Warm up application cache
  - Register with monitoring systems

- **Terminate Hooks**:
  - Backup data or logs
  - Deregister from monitoring
  - Clean up external resources
